Handles all downloads and transfers them to a specific folder through automation.

Basic prototype from Kalle Hallden from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbW6FRbaSl0&t=288s
All other details from me!

Works by placing files in "organize" folder, then transfers it to specific folder. Great for cleaning unorganized huge folders!
